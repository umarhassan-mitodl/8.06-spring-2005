  "course_description": "Together, this course and its predecessor, [8.05: Quantum Physics II](/courses/8-05-quantum-physics-ii-fall-2013/), cover quantum physics with applications drawn from modern physics. Topics in this course include units, time-independent approximation methods, the structure of one- and two-electron atoms, charged particles in a magnetic field, scattering, and time-dependent perturbation theory. In this second term, students are required to research and write a paper on a topic related to the content of 8.05 and 8.06.\n",
