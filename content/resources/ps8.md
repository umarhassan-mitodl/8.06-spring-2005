Problem set on quantum physics. Problems include: Using the semiclassical approximation on the ground state, quantum mechanics of a bouncing ball, application of the semiclassical method to the double well potential, vibrational and rotational spectra in the BornÂ­-Oppenheimer approximation, adiabatic spin rotation, and engineering adiabatic transitions.
